Word of the\\nacquisition also came months after Nexon bought a majority stake in crypto exchange Korbit for\\nroughly $80 million in September 2017.Business Insider later reported in April that Nexon was in\\ntalks to acquire Bitstamp for $350 million.

NXC, Nexon Group\\'s parent\\ncompany, is 98.28 percent owned by Nexon founder Kim Jung-ju and his family.According to the\\nreport, NXC owns 100 percent of a Belgian company called NXMH B.V.B.A., an investment and\\nconsulting firm. NXHM B.V.B.A., with 99 percent ownership, created Bitstamp Holdings N.V., also a\\nBelgian company, on February 1 of this year.The report states that Bitstamp Holdings N.V. acquired\\n100 percent of Bitstamp Japan Co., Ltd on April 25.But while the documents establish a link to\\nBitstamp, it\\'s not clear whether they constitute an \"acquisition\" of Bitstamp given the lack of\\ninformation regarding Bitstamp Japan Co., Ltd. The exchange is run by Bitstamp Limited, which is\\nbased in the United Kingdom and has offices in Luxembourg and New York.A Nexon representative\\nsaid that Bitstamp Holdings isn\\'t the operator of the exchange, and when asked about the\\nrelationship there, the rep said that they \"cannot disclose any further information at this moment.\"\\nBitstamp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Game maker pushIf confirmed, the\\ndeal would represent the latest industry buy for the gaming company, which has released a number\\nof titles for desktop and mobile platforms.The purchase of Bitstamp Japan Co., Ltd also followed a\\nrecord-setting year for Nexon.

However, quite the opposite\\nhappened for Bitcoin as the price has sustained a substantial decline over the past couple of\\ndays.As Bitcoin rapidly dropped in value, BCH has responded in the opposite way, pulling investors\\nand consumers away from the original core chain, moving large amounts of volume into the BCH\\ncamp, and producing . So intense was the price shift, that even Vitalik Buterin publicly congratulated\\nthe chain’s growth.Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Core?Bitcoin Cash has continued to surprise the majority\\nof BTC holders.

That is not entirely surprising, as this slightly modified version of Bitcoin has\\nseen a pretty stellar price trend over the past few days. After rising from US$350 all the way to a\\nnew all-time high of over US$2,400, the major correction everyone knew was coming has finally\\nbegun. It may get very bloody in the coming hours, although the prior uptrend may resume as well,\\nfor all we know.The Bitcoin Cash price is US$1,462.13 at the time of writing. While this is still a 53%\\nincrease compared to 24 hours ago, it is evident the major Bitcoin Cash price party is over as of\\nright now. About an hour ago, this currency was worth US$1,000 more than it is now. It is evident\\nthat BCH’s inflated market capitalization and price would eventually result in people cashing out. It’s\\nmainly the people advocating for this fork to succeed who are taking profits, packing their ball, and\\ngoing home.This sharp drop in price was bound to happen sooner or later. With the Bitcoin Cash\\nprice having been pumped as hard as it has, something had to give sooner or later. Despite high\\ntrading volume all week, it is evident the sellers are starting to outweigh the buyers. A top has been\\nreached at just over 0.5 BTC, even though everyone knows that never represented the true Bitcoin\\nCash price. No one knows what this altcoin should be worth right now, but it’s certainly not\\nUS$2,400.The US$10.15 billion in 24-hour trading volume has certainly helped the Bitcoin Cash\\nprice retain its high value these past few days. Even right now, it is still up by almost 400%\\ncompared to a week or so ago. That in itself is pretty amazing, especially for a cryptocurrency which\\nstill has everything to prove right now. There will be some interesting developments in this regard\\nover the next 48 hours, to say the very least.

       " '[2017-07-11]': \"European Commission Report: Organized Illicit Use of Cryptocurrency “Quite Rare”DCEBrief -\\nhttps://dcebrief.com/european-commission-report-organized-illicit-use-of-cryptocurrency-quite-rare/\\n\\nA number of Bitcoin companies and miners have agreed to run code that will implement a\\nhard-forking increase to the non-witness data in blocks roughly three months after the activation of\\nSegregated Witness (SegWit). According to some of its proponents , the proposal, known as\\nSegWit2x , is said to be the only viable solution to the Bitcoin scaling debate.However, agreeing to\\ninitiate a hard fork without knowing how speculators will react to such a change comes with risks. If\\nthere is not full support for the hard fork from bitcoin holders, the end result could be a split of\\nBitcoin into two separate cryptocurrency networks, which could cause extreme brand confusion\\namong the general public (depending on the severity of the split).In addition to the potential risks of\\na permanent split of the community, SegWit2x also ignores tools that could be used to get the\\nintended benefits of this particular hard-forking increase to capacity without the possibility of a\\nnetwork split.Perhaps most troubling, SegWit2x ignores the reasons as to why Bitcoin is useful in\\nthe first place.Speculators Call the ShotsWhile the original Medium post regarding the New York\\nAgreement claimed the signatories accounted for $5.1 billion worth of monthly on-chain transaction\\nvolume (more than half of the entire network for April), the general view of SegWit2x from bitcoin\\nholders is unclear at this time. Companies representing large amounts of bitcoin holdings ( Digital\\nCurrency Group , Coinbase , Xapo , etc.) have signed onto the agreement as well, but we have yet\\nto see speculators have the chance to set a price for the hard-forked chain.As of now, the hard-fork\\nportion of SegWit2x appears to be contentious, which means exchanges are likely to list both the\\noriginal chain and the chain with a hard-forking increase to the block size limit. Companies that take\\ncustody of their users' bitcoins will need to allow their users to withdraw both coins.Although more\\nthan 80 percent of the network hashrate has agreed to run the SegWit2x code, it's possible that\\nspeculators will prefer the non-hard fork chain. It's also possible that a futures market could illustrate\\nthis point before the hard fork takes place.Of course, miners could decide to mine at a loss and not\\nlisten to the market, which would theoretically go against the incentives of the Bitcoin system. If\\nminers abandon the chain preferred by users, it's possible that a proof-of-work change will be\\nneeded, as faith in the current miners may be lost.Such a scenario could be disastrous for Bitcoin,\\nwhich means miners (and everyone else in the ecosystem) should be incentivized to avoid it. But\\nwe'll have to see what happens.If These Companies Control Bitcoin, Then a Public Blockchain is\\nNot NeededThe point of Bitcoin is that it allows everyone to have full control over their money\\nwithout the need for a trusted third party. There is no third party in Bitcoin because no one controls\\nthe consensus rules . If someone is in control of Bitcoin's consensus rules, then they've effectively\\nbecome the third party that the system was designed to avoid in the first place.With the New York\\nAgreement, the signatories are basically saying they control the rules of Bitcoin (or at least the fork\\nof Bitcoin that they've all agreed to run). If that's the case, then the need for a public blockchain is\\nless clear. Users would effectively be trusting these institutions with the rules of the system and\\nordering of transactions because they could decide to completely change the rules via a hard fork at\\nany point in time. If the system is no longer trustless, Sybil attacks on the state of the blockchain can\\nbe thwarted by having trusted entities sign blocks rather than miners.With that in mind, it may make\\nmore sense to launch a federated sidechain pegged to Bitcoin's main chain instead of trying to turn\\nthe main chain into a trusted system. This would allow the main chain to retain Bitcoin's core value\\n\\n\\x0cproposition of permissionless money while the sidechain can process the microtransactions these\\ncompanies desire.The signatories of the New York Agreement could become the functionaries of the\\nsidechain, where they'd control the consensus rules and sign blocks. This sort of setup makes much\\nmore sense if users are supposed to trust these entities anyway. A much more efficient transaction\\nnetwork can be created when proof-of-work and decentralization are thrown out the window.In fact,\\nthis is exactly what Blockstream 's Liquid sidechain is supposed to achieve early next year .\\nIronically, some of the signers of the New York Agreement are supposed to be participants in\\nBlockstream's upcoming federated sidechain.If there are no goals for SegWit2x other than\\nincreasing capacity on the Bitcoin network, then a federated sidechain is a much better alternative.\\nThere's no risk of a chain split, capacity can be increased exponentially higher than the twofold\\nincrease offered by the hard-fork portion of SegWit2x, and other features, such as Confidential\\nTransactions and faster block times, can also be implemented.Put in this perspective, SegWit2x is\\ncompletely nonsensical. I'm not sure what the New York Agreement will lead to over the next few\\nmonths, but it appears to be unnecessarily\\nrisky.http://www.nasdaq.com/article/op-ed-why-segwit2x-makes-no-sense-cm814759\\n\\n\",\n",

Only a small portion of Bithumb’s funds stored in its hot wallet\\nhas been stolen and the speedy response by the Bithumb team to move funds from its hot wallet to\\ncold or offline wallet allowed the company to prevent a bigger theft.Local investors have claimed that\\nBithumb was aware of the hacking attack since June 16 and its security team and developers tried\\nto prevent the breach from affecting its wallet. Several hacking attempts have been made\\nthroughout the past four days and after failing to cope with the attacks, Bithumb moved coins in its\\nhot wallet to cold wallet as a last resort.According to Chosun, a mainstream media outlet in South\\nKorea, local security experts have told the publication that hackers can breach into local\\n\\n\\x0ccryptocurrency exchanges with ease if they allocate sufficient resources to it.For many months,\\nthroughout 2018, industry experts have encouraged local investors to rely on top cryptocurrency\\nexchanges to trade digital assets to ensure they do not fall victim to hacking attacks and lose\\nfunds.However, in light of the recent Bithumb breach, investors have lost trust in local\\ncryptocurrency exchanges and the market, primarily because the Bithumb hack occurred merely\\nweeks after the $40 million hacking attack of CoinRail was disclosed.Not All Exchanges are\\nHackableWhile most experts in South Korea believe that all local cryptocurrency exchanges are\\nhackable and vulnerable to security breaches, there exists quite a few cryptocurrency trading\\nplatforms that have operated more than five years with a clean record and no signs of\\nbreach.Coinbase (US), Binance (Malta), Gemini (US), UPBit (South Korea), Korbit (South Korea),\\nHuobi (Hong Kong, Kraken (US), Bittrex (US), and BitMEX (Republic of Seychelles) remain as the\\nworld’s leading digital asset trading platforms and yet, none of these exchanges have been\\nhacked.One synonymous quality amongst all of the abovementioned exchanges is that they allocate\\na significant portion of their resources and capital in securing client funds and they all have pride in\\ntheir clean record.Previously, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong\\nhave emphasized their focus on security and their priority on keeping user funds safe.

Coincheck experienced a $530 mln hacking attack\\nas reported by Cointelegraph and yesterday, the largest Nano (RaiBlocks) exchange BitGrail\\nexperienced a security breach.The difference between a hacking attack and a minor server issue is\\nthat with security breaches, anyone can verify the movement of absurdly large amounts of\\ncryptocurrencies from the cryptocurrency exchange’s wallets to external wallets, as seen in the case\\nof Coincheck.Hours before the Coincheck team admitted to a hacking attack, many members of the\\ncryptocurrency community released evidence that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of NEM were\\nmoved from the wallet of Coincheck to external wallets.Thus, if there is no evidence that large sums\\nof funds in cryptocurrencies are transferred from the wallets of a cryptocurrency exchange to\\nexternal wallets, it is irresponsible to suggest the possibility of a hacking attack.On Feb. 11, Binance\\nCEO Changpeng Zhao released a personal statement on the recent Binance server issue and the\\nactions of McAfee.\\xa0 \\xa0 “The real helper was Mr. Mcafee, posting an obviously fake image about us\\nbeing hacked.

The “newly minted crypto rich,”\\nas described by Forbes staff writer Jeff Kauflin, “live in a strange milieu that blends paranoid secrecy\\nwith ostentatious display.”The Forbes “Richest People in Cryptocurrency” list is broken up into five\\ncategories: “idealists, builders, opportunists, infrastructure players and establishment investors.” In\\norder to make the Forbes list, one must have accrued over $350 million.Instead of static numbers,\\nthe net worths of the people on the list are listed in ranges, calculated based on the “estimated\\nholdings of cryptocurrencies (a few provided proof), post-tax profits from trading crypto-assets and\\nstakes in crypto-related businesses.”Forbes acknowledges that they could have left some people off\\nthe list and that their estimates may be “wide of the mark.”The list contains 19 people. One can click\\non each member of the list on Forbes’s website in order to see a short bio and an estimated crypto\\nnet worth.Other data was published along with the list, like the average age of crypto’s richest\\ncompared to the age of Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans (42 vs. 67), and the average daily price\\nvolatility in January 2018 for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) compared to Apple,\\nProctor & Gamble, and gold.When creating the list, Lane spoke with Joe Lubin, the founder of\\nConsensys, about other crypto tycoons’ potential concerns about releasing such data. Lubin, who\\n\\n\\x0cLane referred to as the “statesman of cryptocurrency”, said that he and his peers weren’t looking for\\npublic attention. Lubin also questioned how Forbes could arrive at any accurate numbers, and\\nbrought up the issues of potentially targeting these people for theft. However, Lane adds that Lubin\\nand his “crypto elite” peers did recognize the list’s importance.Kauflin writes that Forbes,“firmly\\nbelieve we made the world a better place by shining a light on the invisible rich. Just as crypto has\\nevolved from the days of the Silk Road drug site and the Mt. Gox digital hijacking, fortunes of this\\nmagnitude should never be allowed to lurk in the shadows.”CryptoWeekly, a cryptocurrency\\nnewsletter, released a comparable list of the top 100 most influential people in the crypto\\ncommunity. Their list is factored not by net worth, but by the research and technological\\ncontributions a person has made in the world of crypto.Among those who were left out of Forbes’\\nrichest in crypto rankings, but included in the CryptoWeekly influential list, are important crypto\\nplayers like Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, and crypto pioneer Nick Szabo,\\namong\\nothers.https://cointelegraph.com/news/forbes-publishes-first-ever-richest-people-in-cryptocurrency-li\\nst\\n\\nAccording to reports on Tuesday, a large quantity of U.S. media outlets were sent an email from an\\nindividual claiming to be a representative of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).

The move by the world’s largest exchange owner will up the\\ngame for the software-created asset and finally bring it some regulatory cover.Just a month ago, a\\ntop CME Group executive said he didn’t foresee listing bitcoin futures any time soon. Chief\\nExecutive Officer Terrence Duffy cited pent-up client demand as a key reason for the reversal.\\nBitcoin climbed to a record high after the news went out Tuesday -- and is up more than 550 percent\\nthis year.“A fully regulated derivatives market is opening the floodgates of institutional demand,” said\\nSpencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital, a San Francisco-based venture capital\\nfirm. And for Wall Street, bitcoin is attractive. “It’s volatile, it trades 24/7 and the markets are\\ninefficient so they provide nice arbitrage opportunities.”At the moment, a startup, LedgerX, is trading\\nbitcoin swaps and options, and Cboe Global Markets Inc. is planning a futures contract by year-end\\nor early 2018, once it gets approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. CME will\\nalso need an OK from the CFTC.With the availability of futures contracts, it will be easier to sell\\nbitcoin short, betting on declines. Liquidity will increase with high-frequency traders acting as market\\nmakers allowed to pursue neutral strategies, ending the day even.A functioning derivatives market\\ncould also give professional traders and investors access to bitcoin without having to deal on\\n\\n\\x0cunfamiliar venues that may be risky in terms of anti-money laundering and know-your-customer\\nrules. It will allow traders to hedge cash positions in the digital money, which to date has been\\ndifficult to do.Cautious Banks“This is big news. As a proxy, gold derivatives markets are much larger\\nthan gold markets. The same could happen here,” said Kyle Samani, managing partner of\\ncryptocurrency hedge fund Multicoin Capital. “Overall, this is a big deal for crypto.\"Wall Street banks\\nhave generally been cautious. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein has said the\\ncompany is open to finding to ways to get involved with the new technology, while Citigroup Inc.\\nChief Financial Officer John Gerspach said his team is taking an “intense” look at cryptocurrencies\\nand the blockchain technology that underlies them. Dimon, JPMorgan’s CEO, has been among the\\nmost outspoken, saying in September that he would fire any employee trading in bitcoin for being\\n“stupid.” A month later, though, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said the bank was “very open\\nminded to the potential use cases in the future for digital currencies that are properly controlled and\\nregulated.”CME will face challenges to win over some investors. If the underlying pricing is unsound,\\nthat could steer people away, said Mark Williams, a finance lecturer at Boston University’s Questrom\\nSchool of Business.‘Very Complex Asset’“The concern is that CME will attempt to treat bitcoin like a\\ncorn or wheat future, when this commodity is in a highly risky class of its own,” Williams said. “One\\nof the major spots to buy and sell bitcoin are through unregulated bucket-shop exchanges located\\noutside of the reach of U.S. regulators.”He noted that since 2009, almost half of these types of\\nexchanges -- including Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin market -- have gone bust. “CME has no\\nother commodity future that looks like or behaves like bitcoin. To me this means trouble.” Jon West,\\nhead trader at digital-asset brokerage Omega One, said the amount of daily margin CME will require\\nwill be key. If it’s too high, “then it’s not very useful for hedging because you need to have so much\\nmoney in your account,” he said. CME should take it slow as it designs its contract, he said. “It’s a\\nvery complex asset with a lot going on.”The CME contract will settle in cash and use a daily price\\nfrom the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, which is supported by digital exchanges Bitstamp, GDAX,\\nitBit and Kraken.CME’s Duffy said on Bloomberg Television that his exchange’s futures contract\\nshould put skeptics at ease. “Bitcoin trading at CME will have an instant audit trail to the government\\nregulator,” he said “That’s what the difference is between our offering and the way it is today.”\\nTraders can’t “circumvent those procedures under our model.”And CME will bring the cryptocurrency\\ninto the big league. “Institutions need derivatives and benchmarks to trade and hedge in order to\\ntake bitcoin to the next level,” said John Spallanzani, chief macro strategist at GFI Securities LLC in\\nNew York. “It doesn’t make bitcoin trading less risky but the ability to hedge that risk is big.”In the\\nrace for first to offer bitcoin derivatives, both CME and Cboe lost out to LedgerX, which won CFTC\\napproval to offer swaps and options on bitcoin and began trading earlier this month. Volumes have\\nbeen light so far. On Tuesday, 103 bitcoin swaps traded on LedgerX, while nine options contracts\\nchanged hands, according to the exchange. The LedgerX options trades are physically delivered,\\ngiving investors who hold a contract to maturity the ability to own bitcoin outright.Ari Paul, a\\nco-founder of Blocktower Capital, said LedgerX is starting out slowly on purpose. “DRW is a market\\nmaker there,” Paul said. “There’s pretty low volume. A million dollars a day. I do expect them to have\\na lot of volume very soon. They are intelligently ramping up.”Many investors can’t maintain\\nownership of bitcoin now -- what’s known as custody -- “either for regulatory reasons or because it’s\\nscary and hard,” Paul said. But in a regulated market like futures, that doesn’t become an issue.\\n“The ability to easily short allows for market-neutral strategies and makes high-frequency trading\\nmuch easier. That draws a lot of attention from hedge funds and the traditional finance\\nworld.”Gadfly: Bitcoin’s push into the mainstreamThe creation of bitcoin futures could make it easier\\nto create an exchange-traded fund based on the digital asset. The U.S. Securities and Exchange\\nCommission in March rejected a bitcoin ETF proposed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss --\\nco-creators of the Gemini exchange -- saying necessary surveillance-sharing agreements were too\\ndifficult given that “significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated.”CME is a giant in trading, with\\nproducts including futures on the S&P 500, oil and gold and customer connections all around the\\nworld. Under Duffy’s leadership, it has pulled back from business interests that didn’t align with its\\nhistoric role as a futures powerhouse, such as shutting down its European operations and exiting\\ncredit-default swap clearing. Its earlier resistance to bitcoin futures was seen as aligned with Duffy’s\\n\\n\\x0cvision of keeping the company’s focus on what it has always done well.“I’m a little concerned about\\nthe fact that both of those futures contracts are cash settled,” said Garrett See, CEO of DV Chain, a\\nsister company of DV Trading, which trades cryptocurrencies. The Cboe contract will be settled\\nusing auctions on the Gemini exchange.See said there has not been a lot of volume in those\\nauctions, raising the question of what will happens if an auction fails, or there’s not enough volume\\nto keep it from being manipulated.“I’m really excited to see derivatives come into the space,” See\\nsaid. “I see it as a great step, but in an ideal world I’d really like to see physical delivery” in\\nfutures.For all the potential downsides, the benefit of increased regulation can’t be overstated,\\nOmega One’s West said. “Futures trading should deter some black-market business and push it into\\nmore regulated places.”Source:\\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-31/bitcoin-growing-up-as-futures-open-floodgate\\ns-to-wall-street\\n\\n',\n",

With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming more mainstream, NFL players are\\nstarting to get involved.One player leading the charge among his professional colleagues is the\\nSeattle Seahawks’ cornerback and four-time Pro Bowler Richard Sherman, who began accepting\\nBitcoin – which he calls “the currency of the future” – as a method of payment for his official\\nmerchandise in 2014.Sherman claims a lot of NFL players are discussing Bitcoin these days, telling\\nCNBC that ever since the dominant cryptocurrency shot up to $19,000, “it has been common\\nconversation for a lot of us.”The prolific cornerback is currently nursing an injury to his Achilles\\ntendon and has used the time to study up on the whole cryptocurrency market.

However,\\nSherman knows he isn’t a financial advisor, and thus refrains from giving them financial advice,\\nexplaining:\"You read up, you hear great things about some [coins], you hear terrible things about\\nothers, they fluctuate throughout the day. It is such an unpredictable market.\"Despite the volatility,\\nSherman is happily invested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – and he believes they are one\\noption to help NFL players diversify their investment portfolios and protect their wealth, telling\\nCNBC:\"A lot of them have just been trying their best to become more educated on not only\\ncryptocurrencies, but just stocks and trading in general […] So people in my sport, in my field, are\\ndefinitely becoming more educated and trying to be more intelligent with how they play for the\\nmoney and understanding where their money is going.\"Hopefully, that means they’re buying the\\ndips.http://bitcoinist.com/nfl-players-interested-in-tackling-bitcoin-securing-futures-with-cryptocurrenc\\ny/\\n\\n',\n",

Q) As a professional in cryptocurrencies and blockchain, could you\\nbriefly explain what is the current situation in the crypto market regarding coin prices going up and\\ndown?AF) At the rise of the year prices at the cryptocurrency market began falling. Certain\\ncurrencies lost more than 40% of their value. This worried many market participants. However, if to\\nanalyze the situation during the last three years, it is obvious that this reduction is temporary and\\nseasonal. After this, it will rise again reaching its new peak values. In 2017 a lot of new\\ncryptocurrencies have entered the market. This attracted many new players among individual\\ntraders and investors so as VC funds all over the world. In our opinion, the cryptocurrency market\\nwill continue developing, and the capitalization will increase. Regulators will begin normalizing\\ncryptocurrency trade. This will reduce volatility and will lead to a further increase in the number of\\nparticipants of the global cryptomarket on a long-term horizon.Q) How does cryptocurrency pricing\\naffect the crypto market regarding investments? Is it safe to invest in crypto now or is there some\\nrisks?AF) We do not think that we have the right to give advice and recommendations on investing\\ninto certain ICOs or cryptocurrencies, but we can give general recommendations. The seasonal\\nmarket fall is a good time for profitable investments for a term of 4-6 months. From our point of view\\ninvesting in cryptocurrency is still a very risky business. So it is important to diversify investments\\nand contribute to a portfolio of various assets. Not only BTC and ETH would be added there, but\\nalso other cryptocurrencies with high growth potential. Remember our example with Ripple price?\\nWe consider that an ICO with a reasonable token structure and value which grow during the project\\ndevelopment can show good profitability. We would recommend being cautious with those projects\\nwhich spend too much money on advertising and promotional activities. This means that they are\\nfund-raising–oriented, but not product-oriented. Result-oriented projects will not “burn” enormous\\namounts of marketing funds for self-advertising....\\n\\n',\n",

The ETF tracks the value of these assets and is\\ntradable during the working hours on an exchange. Shareholders are entitled to a share of the\\nfund’s profits, which are based on either longer-term earned interest or short-term speculation on\\ndaily market fluctuations.Huobi’s new ETF - called ‘Huobi 10’ - is based on its recently launched\\nmarket index, which tracks the exchange’s 10 top-traded digital assets against Tether (USDT) in real\\ntime, using a weighted average calculation method.Huobi suggests the new investment instrument\\nwill potentially help new users to gain exposure to the crypto markets by giving them a stake in a\\ndiversified basket of assets. This would reportedly allow investors who do not want to follow\\nindividual crypto assets to buy into the general market trend and disregard the ‘noise’ of individual\\ncoins.Huobi’s ETF is now open for subscriptions, with an option to pay using either Tether (USDT),\\nBitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or Huobi’s native token (HT). Subscriptions are limited to a range of\\nbetween 100 USDT and 10 million USDT or equivalent for each account.Crypto-based ETFs have\\nlong been discussed as a potential ‘holy grail’ for the crypto industry.

In leading bitcoin\\nexchange markets with the exception of the US, bitcoin premiums emerge when bitcoin’s volatility\\nincreases.On June 12, bitcoin price achieved a new all-time high at $3,017 as demand from investor\\nreached a peak on major bitcoin exchanges. However, after a massive sell-off by investors\\npresuming a market correction, bitcoin price experienced a sharp 14 percent 24-hour drop, to\\naround $2590. Within 24 hours since the fall, bitcoin price recovered in a relatively short period of\\ntime, to $2,750.Amidst bitcoin’s volatile price trend, premiums in China, Japan and South Korea, the\\nsecond, third and fourth largest bitcoin exchange markets reemerged. Although the premium rate\\ndemonstrated by the three markets is not as high as it once was, the three markets are trading\\nbitcoin at around a 10 percent premium in comparison to the US, the largest bitcoin exchange\\nmarket.At the time of reporting, bitcoin is being traded in the US for around $2,680. In Japan, bitcoin\\nis being traded with a $100 premium and in China and Japan, investors are trading bitcoin with a\\n$200 premium.On June 11, CCN reported that bitcoin price stabilized in the $2,900 region after a\\nmajor market correction in late May, as the big three bitcoin exchanges in the Chinese market\\nincluding OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC resumed withdrawals for local traders and investors.The\\nresumption of withdrawals for Chinese traders allowed the Chinese bitcoin exchange market to\\nsurpass Japan and South Korea to reclaim its position as the second largest market behind US. The\\nChinese market’s short-term recovery provided the global bitcoin exchange market with stability,\\ndematerializing premiums in the Japanese and South Korean markets.However, despite the\\nChinese market acting as a catalyst to stabilize the global market, bitcoin’s high fluctuation and\\nvolatility led major markets to swing wildly. Such instability led to the resurfacing of high premiums in\\nmajor markets, particularly in South Korea.In previous coverage, CCN provided extensive analysis\\non the premium rates in South Korea and Japan due to the two countries’ strict anti-money\\nlaundering (AML) policies and regulatory frameworks. Robust AML systems make it extremely\\ndifficult for anyone within and outside of the South Korean and Japanese markets to take advantage\\nof bitcoin arbitrage opportunities without being flagged by regulatory agencies.More to that, the\\ninstability of the entire cryptocurrency market and the underwhelming performance of the top 30\\n\\n\\x0ccryptocurrencies is increasing premium rates in Japan, China and South Korea.

In the three above mentioned\\nmarkets, premiums have always existed, even when bitcoin price hit its peak at $3,000. Based on\\nthe mid-term bitcoin price trend, premiums on the three markets only dematerializes when the entire\\nmarket stabilizes.Additionally, during extreme fluctuations, bitcoin exchanges suffer from outages\\ndue to explosive customer demand.

Following is a transcript of the video.Tom Lee: I\\'m here\\nwith Sara to talk about why we believe bitcoin could reach $25,000 in 5 years.Sara Silverstein: So\\nyou actually have a few research notes about this.Lee: Yes.Silverstein: And you’re — can you talk\\nabout your short-term model first. Where do you see bitcoin going and what valuation method are\\nyou using?Lee: Yeah, in the short-term we think bitcoin has really followed very closely the idea of\\nacting like a social network. Meaning the more engagement there is, the greater the value rises. And\\nin the short-term, we think bitcoin will reach at least $6,000 by mid-2018.Silverstein: And you’re\\nusing Metcalfe’s Law, can you explain that?Lee: Yeah, so Metcalfe’s a professor. He actually came\\nup with a theorem based on George Gilder, which is the value of a network is the square of the\\nnumber of users. And so if you build a very simple model valuing bitcoin as the square function\\nnumber of users times the average transaction value. 94% of the bitcoin moved over the past four\\nyears is explained by that equation.Silverstein: Wow. Just to use an example, so this explains the\\nnetwork effect. Like one fax machine is worthless because there\\'s nobody you can fax. But once all\\nof your friends have fax machines, it becomes very valuable. So has this been effective in valuing\\n\\n\\x0cthings, in the past, that have a strong network but weren\\'t producing any money?Lee: Yeah, so\\nthree use cases — or businesses — where Metcalfe’s Law really explain the growth of the market\\nvalue, is Facebook, Alibaba, and Google. And these are all examples where the number of users —\\nlike if you double the number of users, you\\'re more than doubling the utility value. It\\'s a little bit like\\nthe commercial in the 70s, you know, Prell. When you tell your friends, and they tell their friends,\\nand so on.Silverstein: And so your long-term valuation model — you’re looking at it — bitcoin, as a\\nsubstitute for gold, as an alternative currency?Lee: Yes, that’s right, and it\\'s really — what we were\\ntrying to do is recognize that the creation of value in the future is in the digital world. I mean, all\\nfuture great business are going to be digital. And with that concept, bitcoin represents a store of\\nvalue because it\\'s an encrypted — personal encrypted database, that for seven years hasn\\'t been\\nhacked. I mean, that is a way to store value. And if personal information is our gold, bitcoin is our\\ndigital gold. So we think that the gold market, which is 9 trillion, and for a generation of investors\\ngold was their store of value. I think this next generation of young people view bitcoin as their store\\nof value. And if it captures 5% of the gold market, it\\'s worth at least $25,000 per unit.Silverstein: And\\nthat’s the big number, that your — the $25,000 per unit hinges on the 5% of the money going into\\ngold, going into bitcoin. So how do you come up with the 5%?Lee: We explain this in our research.\\nIt\\'s a very —\\xa0 it\\'s actually the most conservative collection of elements to get to the 5%. Because\\nnumber one, we assume that gold only appreciates essentially a nominal GDP. So there\\'s no\\ninflation. And we assume that money supply grows at slower rates than it has historically. And then\\nthe 5% number, really reflects the assumption that investors will allocate in their blended portfolio\\nonly 5% to alternative currencies. Today, that allocation is much greater, it\\'s closer to 10% or 15% in\\nsome portfolios. So, but at a 5% allocation that would value bitcoin at $25,000. You could easily get\\nto $100,000, $200,000 numbers.Link to the video and the full script:\\nhttp://uk.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-how-to-value-fundstrat-tom-lee-2017-10?r=US&IR=T\\n\\n',\n",

Launch Set For Mid-2019, Says Russian Blockchain AssociationThe Russian\\nAssociation of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB) has announced that the government’s\\nlong-discussed idea for a state-issued cryptocurrency, referred to as the CryptoRuble, will be\\nlaunched in the middle of 2019.The Russian government has been going back and forth on\\nlaunching the CryptoRuble (known earlier as the Bitruble) since 2015. As recently as late December\\n2017 during a meeting on legislation for digital currencies, the Deputy Minister of Finance and the\\nfirst Deputy Governor of Russia's Central Bank both stated that they did not think it was necessary\\nfor the state to issue its own cryptocurrency.According to Arseniy Sheltsin, the head of RACIB,\\ndetails of the CryptoRuble project will be officially presented and discussed in July 2018, and the\\ncoin itself should be issued a year later. The Government and the Central Bank of Russia are also\\nexpected to prepare regulatory measures for Initial Cryptocurrency Offerings (ICOs) and\\ncryptocurrency mining by July 2018.Early in 2018, one of President Putin’s counselors noted that\\nthe CryptoRuble could help the Russian government strengthen the economy by avoiding the\\nimpact of international sanctions against the country.According to Russian crypto journal Forklog,\\nthe coin is set to be pegged to the ruble, non-mineable, and will be the only legal cryptocurrency in\\nthe country. The government hopes the CryptoRuble will attract foreign cryptocurrency\\ninvestments.Overall, the highest leaders in the Russian government have held mixed to negative\\nopinions towards cryptocurrencies. At a state press conference on January 12, Putin stated:\\xa0 \\xa0 “It is\\nknown that there is nothing behind the cryptocurrency, and it cannot be a store of value, it doesn’t\\nhave any material value, and it’s not backed by anything...”Russia’s Prime Minister, Dmitry\\nMedvedev, also recently criticized cryptocurrencies at the Gaidar’s Forum in Moscow. He compared\\n\\n\\x0cthe virtual currency trend with the dotcom bubble and suggested that most cryptocurrencies are\\nlikely to cease to exist, while Blockchain technology will remain, declaring:\\xa0 \\xa0 “We can not completely\\nexclude the scenario that took place at the beginning of the 90s when many companies arose on the\\nbasis of the developing Internet technology and in the beginning of the 2000s those companies\\nmostly disappeared from the scene.\\xa0 Nonetheless, the technology itself not only survived but\\ncurrently plays an important role in our life. In a likely manner cryptocurrencies may disappear in\\nseveral years, but the technology which stands behind them, I mean blockchain, will become a part\\nof our everyday reality. This scenario cannot be denied,”In response to the Russian government’s\\nrecent critique of cryptocurrencies, the CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board of the largest\\nRussian bank Sberbank Herman Gref called on the authorities to not ban virtual currencies. Gref\\nconsiders both cryptocurrencies and Blockchain to be the “new huge technologies whose power\\ncannot be realized at the moment.” He also declared “in no circumstances should [cryptocurrency]\\nbe banned”.Several other countries have also announced plans to introduce their own state-issued\\ncryptocurrencies, such as Venezuela and Senegal.Source:\\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/is-cryptoruble-back-launch-set-for-mid-2019-says-russian-blockchai\\nn-association\\n\\n\",\n",

Bitcoin has soared\\nby more than 750% in the past year and is worth four times as much as an ounce of gold.But the\\nprice has been volatile. The digital currency plunged below $3,000 in mid-September after the\\nChinese authorities announced a crackdown. Beijing ordered cryptocurrency exchanges to stop\\ntrading and block new registrations, due to fears that increasing numbers of consumers piling into\\nthe bitcoin market could prompt wider financial problems.ordan Hiscott, the chief trader at Ayondo\\nMarkets, said: “The returns are truly remarkable, especially given the recent ban on bitcoin trading in\\nChina, where demand had previously accounted for at least 10% of all global volumes.”Vladimir\\nPutin, the Russian president, called this week for regulation of cryptocurrencies, saying their use\\n“bears serious risks” such as money laundering, tax evasion and funding for terrorism. But he also\\nwarned against imposing “too many barriers,” which appears to have given bitcoin a boost.Despite\\nwarnings over a bubble, bitcoin is gaining in acceptance. Last month, a London property developer,\\nThe Collective, said it would allow its tenants to pay their deposits in bitcoin and accept rent\\npayments in the cryptocurrency by the end of the year. Two weeks ago, Japan’s government\\nimplemented rules that recognise bitcoin as a payment method. Celebrities have also got involved,\\nwith the boxer Floyd Mayweather, the socialite Paris Hilton and the actor Jamie Foxx promoting coin\\nofferings.Using bitcoin allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment processes to pay for\\ngoods and services directly. Banks and other financial institutions have been concerned about\\nbitcoin’s associations with money laundering and online crime because transactions take place\\nanonymously.The soaring value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies comes despite growing\\nwarnings over a price bubble.The starkest warning came from the JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie\\nDimon, who said bitcoin was a fraud that would ultimately blow up. Speaking last month, he said\\nthere was a limited market for the digital currency, arguing that it was only fit for use by drug dealers,\\n\\n\\x0cmurderers and people living in countries such as North Korea. He pledged to sack any JP Morgan\\ntrader investing in Bitcoin, but also admitted he had not been able to dissuade his daughter from\\ninvesting.Dimon declined to comment on the surge in bitcoin during an earnings call on Thursday.\\n“I’m not going to talk about bitcoin any more,” he said.Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics\\nand public policy at Harvard University and a former IMF chief economist, has predicted that the\\ntechnology behind cryptocurrencies will thrive, but the price of bitcoin will collapse.“It is folly to think\\nthat bitcoin will ever be allowed to supplant central bank-issued money,” he wrote in the Guardian\\nthis week.“It is one thing for governments to allow small anonymous transactions with virtual\\ncurrencies; indeed, this would be desirable. But it is an entirely different matter for governments to\\nallow large-scale anonymous payments, which would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or\\ncounter criminal activity.”Daniel Murray, global head of research at EFG Asset Management, noted\\nthat in 2013, bitcoin soared twelvefold in just four months but within a month had lost a third of its\\nvalue and four months after its peak had lost 60% of its value.“Investors buy [an] asset because\\nthey are seduced by the prospect of further rapid gains without necessarily thinking about intrinsic\\nvalue,” he said. He noted that historically currencies were backed by precious metals, and these\\ndays most currencies were based on macroeconomic fundamentals such as inflation, interest rates\\nand growth, and were backed by a central bank and government. None of this applied to bitcoin,\\nalthough the supply is carefully controlled.“It is hard to argue that bitcoin does anything better than\\nexisting currency arrangements whilst it does some things to a lower standard,” Murray added.\\n“Individuals are already able to transact electronically using a plastic card.”Since you’re here ……\\nwe have a small favour to ask.

Here’s all you need to know…What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin\\nis a virtual currency which was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi\\nNakamoto.Transactions are made without middle men, so there are no transaction fees and no\\nneed to give your real name.More businesses are beginning to accept them and in some parts of\\nthe world you can even buy pizza with bitcoins.You can set up a virtual wallet websites like\\nBlockchain to store,\\xa0 keep track and spend your digital money.You are also able to purchase Bitcoin\\nthrough an online exchange or Bitcoin ATM.To find merchants that accepts Bitcoin in the UK click\\nhere.Bitcoins aren’t printed, like pounds, dollars or euros – they’re produced by people, and\\nincreasingly businesses, running computers all around the world.It’s the first example of a growing\\ncategory of money known as cryptocurrency.Bitcoin is attractive to some users because of its\\nanonymity, as well as its lack of government control.The website Silk Road was closed in 2013\\nfollowing raids by the FBI and other agencies amid allegations of drug dealing with authorities\\nseizing millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin during the raids.How does Bitcoin work?The value of\\nBitcoin, like all currencies, is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.To\\nprocess Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ‘mining’ must take place, which involves a\\ncomputer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.For each problem solved,\\none block of Bitcoins is processed.In addition the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins.To\\ncompensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to\\nensure a steady stream of new bitcoins are produced each day.There are currently about 15 million\\nin existence.(...)https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3000715/bitcoin-nhs-pound-sterling/\\n\\nWhat Are “Quindecillions” In A Bitcoin Context?You may never hear the word \"quindecillions\"\\noutside of a Bitcoin context, but it\\'s an important and useful concept for understanding how the\\ncryptocurrency works.Satoshi Nakamoto’s original paper introduced Bitcoin “as a purely\\npeer-to-peer version of electronic cash (that) would allow online payments to be sent directly from\\none party to another without going through a financial institution.” Bitcoin brought with it a\\nmechanism that overcomes the inherent weaknesses of the traditional transaction model, which is\\nbased on a third-party mediation or trust. These weaknesses create a number of inconveniences in\\nthe form of increasing transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size, and cutting\\noff the possibility to make non-revocable payment. Bitcoin overcomes such flaws, as it’s based on\\ncryptographic proof instead of a ‘trusted’ third\\nparty.http://www.investopedia.com/news/what-are-quindecillions-bitcoin-context/\\n\\n',\n",

Join Hacked.com for just $39 now.What’s more, the train only handles 4,000 individuals\\nand arrives every ten minutes, during which period new individuals arrive at a rate of 4 per second.\\nNow, it’s ok, you’re busy, you can still be one of those 4,000 individuals and get to work if you pay a\\nhigh enough fee.So you check out the notice which says the current estimated fee is $1, but since\\nothers are seeing the same notice too and paying $1 too, the fee keeps going up every second, with\\nthese higher fees paid by the new individuals that come every second, pushing you down the\\nqueue.Tough luck, you can’t make it to work today because your $1 bid is now as good as worthless\\nto the super congested network. The next day you learn the lesson, so instead of bidding what the\\nnotice says, you bid 10% or 20% more, but you weren’t the only one who missed work yesterday,\\nalmost everyone else did too and they have this genius but obvious idea too, making you miss work\\nagain.The next day you get angry and pay double the fee, but you’re not the only angry one. Now,\\nsure, some in this lottery do get to make it to work, 4,000 every 10 minutes with 200,000 waiting, but\\na lot don’t, resulting in a bidding war which looks like below:As can be seen, bitcoin’s fees have\\ngone vertical, which is bad, but if you know you’d get through for x dollars then at least you can\\nevaluate the proposition. Instead, you’re not only paying high fees, but you don’t even know whether\\nyou will get the service you paid for because of simple logics.Let’s take, for example, a statement by\\nLuke Dashjr, a Blockstream “open hash contractor,” who suggested everyone pay a $5 fee and\\nyou’ll get through. If we analyze this a bit further, we can start by asking why people are not paying\\n$5 and one good reason is because then everyone would start paying $5 meaning newcomers\\nwould outbid them by paying $5.01.Sure, one or two guys might currently “cheat” and jump the\\nqueue by paying $5, but as long as it’s a very tiny minority the rest let it go. If instead, it went to a\\npoint where say 1,000 of the 4,000 are paying $5, the other 3,000 will probably quickly start paying\\n$5.01.This clearly shows ordering transactions by fee is an unworkable idea which is why Satoshi\\nNakamoto ordered transactions by first seen in the bitcoin clients he/she released, a rule largely\\nenforced by the bitcoin network until full capacity was reached.The Easy AttackStill, even the above\\nproblems, as bad as they are, might be bearable for desperate bitcoiners, but let’s imagine I’m a\\nwealthy company, say Vusa, or Rapp Labs, or a wealthy guy who just doesn’t like bitcoin.Just to be\\nvery clear, no one is suggesting either of them has behaved in any nefarious way, but say I’m a\\ncompetitor to bitcoin or recently attracting much hype and attention due to gaining crazy high market\\ncap in just days. You know what I could do with just $2 million?I could send bitcoin down crashing as\\nfar as its sole purpose of moving bitcoins is concerned. That’s because bitcoin’s capacity is limited\\nto around 250,000 transactions, but just to make it simple let’s say it can handle only 200,000\\ntransactions a day.At $1, it would cost me just $200,000 to take up that space, which is fine,\\neveryone else could pay $1.50. But, at $10 per transaction it would cost me only $2 million to send\\neveryone else at the back of the queue.Now sure, you can pay $11 or $12, but even at a fee of $20\\nit would cost just $4 million, as good as nothing considering how much value may flood to the\\ncompetitors and considering the shock bitcoin would receive if all the sudden everyone is asked to\\npay $25 per transaction.There is no evidence to suggest this is happening at scale, but fees went up\\nyesterday from around $1 to around $4 for a normal transaction. It could be ordinary demand, but it\\ncould also be someone or some entity which wants to send bitcoin crashing.They have succeeded\\nas far as bitcoin’s sole purpose of moving bitcoins around is concerned because around 200,000\\nbitcoins have been stuck for the past 24 hours while fees have gone parabolic pricing everyone\\nout.Another Obituary?Bitcoin has only one job – to move data from a to b – and it is failing to do that\\nsimple task. A task which is not really rocket science as some claim because everyone and their cat\\nhave launched their own bitcoin like network which actually manages to continue performing their\\none task.No wonder bitcoin’s market share has now fallen down to around 48%, nearly halved from\\njust a few months ago, but its price has now doubled to more than $2,000 and its market cap keeps\\ngoing up, so, who knows. Maybe $20 fees and days for one transaction are a good thing?Or maybe\\nit’s all just because of the recent advertising following allegations Trump’s Press Secretary and an\\naid to the French President Macron had used bitcoin, combined with the recent ransom global\\n\\n\\x0cincident.Or perhaps it’s only because bitcoin is the main gateway to other altcoins, although\\nethereum has started making inroads on that front due to its own tokens system and clones.But\\nmaybe the market sees value in a limited coin you just buy and lock away in some paper wallet\\nsomewhere, forgetting about it, like actual gold and just as difficult as well as expensive to move\\naround.In which case, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” as bitcoin’s white paper\\ndescribes it, has failed, because the current bitcoin is not a cash system. Cash can be exchanged\\nalmost instantly with 0 fee and can be moved around fairly easily without getting stuck for\\ndays.Which might be why the market is giving conflicting signals. On the one hand, it’s falling market\\nshare is probably because bitcoin investors and other market participants are looking for the real\\nbitcoin, the cash system, which many think has just changed its name to ethereum while getting\\nsome cool new tech like smart contracts.It may be that these newcomers think bitcoin is still the\\ncash system rather than seemingly having changed into something else, or maybe they like this idea\\nof gold but with very high fees or they’re in markets which have no choice, although even they could\\neasily diversify.Bitcoin is Dead, Long Live BitcoinSo, to conclude, bitcoin is definitely in crisis\\nbecause the real bitcoin as described in the whitepaper does not exist anymore. The real bitcoin\\nuses the first seen rule for transactions, rather than ordering by fee. The real bitcoin never operates\\nat full blocks. The real bitcoin has as good as no fees and confirms almost instantly.What now is\\ncalled bitcoin is an aberration, something completely different and planned to become even more\\ndifferent.

It’s often useful to look at things quantitatively instead.So here, what\\nwe really want to understand is the probability of bitcoin reaching $500,000. There are a few ways to\\ndo that.First, we can assume a completely random process and take a “gambler’s ruin” perspective.\\nWhat is the probability that a random process will hit $500,000 before it hits $0? Given that the price\\nas of Dec 2017 is about $15,000, we’d get $15,000/$500,000 = 3%.Another approach is to model\\nprice as a lognormal process, which is a reasonable assumption to make for a broad set of assets.\\nSee Why do prices and income follow a log-normal distribution?We’d then need to estimate volatility\\nand expected return of bitcoin. Expected return is harder to estimate — we can use the historical\\nreturn, but that’s a pretty biased estimate. For example, if you pick a stock that performed the best\\nout of the S&P 500 in the last 5 years, would you expect that stock to have the same expected\\nreturn going forward? Mostly likely not. Same with bitcoin — unless you already made a prediction\\nof its expected return before the really high realized return we see now, your Bayesian prior should\\nbe lower.With that said, the general methodology of how to estimate distribution with a lognormal\\nprocess for asset price is described here: John Young's answer to What is the bitcoin price\\n\\n\\x0cprediction for 2019?Based on this, depending on how liberal you are about estimating expected\\nreturn, you’d be looking at a probability in the 1–10% range of reaching $500,000 in the next\\nyear.Further methods would involve looking at option prices. Right now, there’s not a particularly\\nliquid market for options yet, but with bitcoin futures opening today, that may change soon. With\\noption prices, you’d actually be able to trade a call option with $500,000 strike, and the price of this\\noption would roughly be proportional to the probability of reaching that level by a certain maturity\\ndate.So — to summarize, we are probably looking at a range of 1–10% probability of reaching\\n$500,000 in the next year, depending on how you model it. Beyond that, it’s harder to know, with\\nchanges happening to the market like introduction of futures, but eventually there may be a liquid\\nmarket for making such predictions through options.Source\\n\\n‘Go Beyond Headlines, Hype to Find Crypto Risks’ Urges Idaho Finance ChiefIdaho lawmakers\\nhave told the public to “look beyond the headlines” so they can “understand the risks” posed by\\ninvesting in cryptocurrency.In an official news release Thursday, the state’s Department of Finance\\n(DATE) quoted director Gavin Lee saying investors should avoid “hype” when products or services\\ninvolving cryptocurrency of any kind are involved.He warned:\\xa0 \\xa0 “Investors should go beyond the\\nheadlines and hype to understand the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies, as well\\nas cryptocurrency futures contracts and other financial products where these virtual currencies are\\nlinked in some way to the underlying investment.”In issuing the warning, Idaho joins the growing\\n\\n\\x0cregulatory patchwork in effect across the US, with different states adopting fragmented attitudes\\ntowards virtual currency.

Another slight cause of concern is that volumes\\nremain weak as well.\\xa0The rebound from the 100-day moving average followed by a convincing break\\nabove the 50-day moving average (as seen in July) coupled with a bullish relative strength index\\n(RSI) and the directional movement index (DMI) indicate scope for a rally to $4,692 (September 6\\nhigh) and possibly $5,000 (record high).DMI is used to confirm price action, and a bullish crossover\\noccurs when the green line crosses up through the red line.Only a convincing break below $4,180\\n(confluence of the 50-day moving average and the rising trend line) would abort short-term bullish\\nbias on bitcoin.\\xa0Despite the bullish break above the 50-day moving average, volumes have\\nremained low.The average directional index (ADX) line is sloping downwards, suggesting the bullish\\nmove lacks strength.ViewAlthough the medium-term outlook is constructive, a minor pullback to\\n$4,200 cannot be ruled out, courtesy of weak volumes and lack of strength as indicated by the ADX\\nline.Source:\\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/slow-ascent-bitcoin-prices-edge-higher-despite-weak-volumes/\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '[2018-04-17]': 'Cryptocurrencies are regularly accused of causing “deaths in a fairly direct way” (as Bill Gates put\\nit). A report released by The Foundation for Defense of Democracies found that less than one\\npercent of Bitcoin is used for illegal purposes.Bitcoin Not as Criminal as Some Might ThinkAaron\\nShamo, a 28-year-old Bitcoin enthusiast who became a millionaire since the cryptocurrency rally in\\nlate 2017, was found to be a drug dealer, according to the police. Shamo has allegedly trafficked\\nfentanyl, a powerful opioid, which may have caused 28 fatal overdoses and is now in prison awaiting\\ntrial. He has pleaded not guilty as he faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted.The modus\\noperandi of the alleged drug ring used Bitcoin as the means of payment. “We have switched to\\nbitcoin payments only. Now you will enjoy a 10 percent less price tag on all products. Good part is\\nthat paying by bitcoin you can order as much as you like with no limit”, said an e-mail from the\\ndealer.Law enforcement found six websites offering fentanyl and all of them listed Bitcoin as the\\npreferred method of payment. “Because it’s anonymous, it’s the currency of choice for these drug\\ntraffickers,” said Ohio Republican Rob Portman, head of a Senate committee investigating the\\nmatter. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called the use of Bitcoin on the dark web “a big\\nproblem.”Most cryptocurrency advocates dismiss the argument that Bitcoin is a problem. “Blaming\\nBitcoin for this crisis would make as much sense as blaming the internet or cars that drug traffickers\\nhave to use”, said Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.The anonymity\\nargument is also problematic as buying Bitcoin requires real money and cryptocurrency exchanges\\nnow collect personal information from users, who also need to convert their Bitcoin back into fiat for\\nconsumer spending. “At some point, Bitcoin is only as good as where you can spend it. You look at\\nwhere the currency enters the mainstream financial system in order to get spent”, said a Justice\\nDepartment official.The Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a foreign policy think tank,\\nreleased a report that found less than one percent of Bitcoin is used for illegal purposes and almost\\nall of the illicit activity came from transactions on the dark web;“Better privacy may be a critical\\nfeature for legal cryptocurrency use to grow, but this must be balanced with the need for law\\nenforcement to be able to trace transactions in some circumstances,”Tom Robinson, Chief Data\\nOfficer at Elliptic, said the report“demonstrates the transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain, and the\\nanalytical techniques that can be used by law enforcement to trace and apprehend cybercriminals,\\nand by financial institutions to prevent the reintroduction of this dirty money into the mainstream\\nfinancial system.”Crime has existed long before Bitcoin and will continue to leverage new\\ntechnologies to its own\\nbenefit.https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/17/report-less-1-bitcoin-used-illegal-purposes/\\n\\nBitcoin isn\\'t for payments?While that may be the popular narrative of late, don\\'t tell that to Bellatorra\\nSkin Care, a luxury brand that has found the opposite as it\\'s expanded internationally into markets\\nsuch as China and India.Not only is bitcoin (which has seen years of declining interest from\\nmerchants as the network bumped up against its limits) a sought-after choice for\\nbusiness-to-business (B2B) payments, but for retail payments, other cryptocurrencies are finding a\\nfoothold as well.\"We expanded our business internationally this past year, and have had strong\\ndemand [for cryptocurrency] from customers in markets such as China and India, where fiat\\ncross-border transactions have inefficiencies,\" said Nathan Halsey, the CEO of Bellatorra, based in\\nBeverly Hills, California.Halsey told CoinDesk:\"We have found cryptocurrency to be a viable solution\\nfor resolving these challenges, and we see other companies with international business adopting the\\nsame practices.\"Indeed, one of the early use cases highlighting bitcoin\\'s innovation was\\ncross-border payments where there were bottlenecks and high fees for transacting.Bellatorra ran\\ninto these hurdles in Asian markets and says its wholesale customers began asking for the option of\\npaying in bitcoin. So in July 2017, the company began a relationship with bitcoin merchant services\\nprovider BitPay.\"We have completed multiple six-figure transactions, without an issue, and have\\nsettled funds from the time of customer payment to settling in U.S. dollars in our U.S. bank accounts\\nin less than one business day,\" Halsey continued.And according to BitPay CEO Stephen Pair,\\nBellatorra\\'s experience in circumventing cumbersome traditional payments rails with crypto isn\\'t\\nuncommon. Cosmetic companies such as Nuciya Beauty in Canada have found that people tend to\\nspend more per purchase when they use cryptocurrency.As such, Bellatorra is looking into adopting\\nother cryptocurrencies, and making them a bigger segment of their business, in the future.\"We are\\ndefinitely pro-cryptocurrency as a payment option,\" Halsey said, adding that the company has\\nstarted holding onto small amounts of the cryptocurrencies it accepts instead of immediately cashing\\nout.Full article: https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-payments-are-booming-in-asia/\\n\\n',\n",

It turned out that MtGOX was insolvent, and had a trade bot\\nartificially pumping the price.The price crashed quickly and continued to go down for a while,\\nbottoming out at $600. This event was followed by nearly a two-year bear market, with little to no\\nprice growth. It wasn’t until 2016 when the value started to pick up again, and by the end of the year,\\nit was back over $1000.2017 was one of the best years Bitcoin has every seen, starting at just\\naround $1000 at the beginning of the year and it stopped for no one. It quickly soared to $2500, and\\neven over $3000 before the correction. By December, Bitcoin was over $10,000. Some exchanges\\nshowed bitcoin prices over $20,000, but the current price sits just around $15,000.Bitcoin has a\\nmassive amount of momentum going for it right now, and 2018 is slated to be just as exciting.

Banning ads is\\nseen as cutting off the oxygen to the crypto bad actors, which will help legitimate enterprises.Of\\ncourse, another major reason behind the banning of cryptocurrency ads is that of liability.

       " '[2017-04-17]': 'Bitcoin is Now Larger Than Some Fiat Currencies in Europe & Americas in Market CapThe user\\nbase and market cap of bitcoin are larger than most fiat currencies of small countries in Central\\nAmerica, Africa and Europe. The next step for bitcoin is to surpass the market cap of reserve\\ncurrencies, to establish itself as the global currency used by mainstream users and general\\nconsumers.The truth is, bitcoin as a technology is not capable of surpassing the value or user base\\nof reserve currencies as of yet. Various scaling issues have to be addressed and solutions must be\\nimplemented. One of these solutions is Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness. If both the on-chain\\ncapacity and two-layer solutions of bitcoin are expanded and improved, bitcoin will be able to\\ncompete with larger fiat and reserve currencies of the world.Still, the bitcoin network has\\ndemonstrated a significant rate of growth in terms of market cap and user base. Most notably,\\nBlockchain, a popular bitcoin wallet platform, recorded over 6 million new users in the past 12\\nmonths. Other competing wallet platforms such as Coinbase have also shown a rapid growth rate,\\nwith the Coinbase wallet platform serving over 6 million users.// Get exclusive analysis of bitcoin and\\nlearn from our tutorials.

Apart from these regular day-to-day users, there\\nexists many investors in regulated bitcoin exchange and trading platforms such as BitFlyer, Bitfinex\\nand Bitstamp that hold bitcoin as an investment.According to an infographic provided by a user of a\\nbitcoin online community, the userbase of bitcoin is larger than many countries including Norway\\nand Finland. The market cap of bitcoin is higher than the majority of fiat currencies in the world.\\nBitcoin has a higher market cap than the currencies of the following countries:Mongolia, Bolivia,\\n\\n\\x0cParaguay, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Laos, Sudan, Senegal, Nigeria and more. The full list of\\ncountries can be seen in the infographic shown below:Importance of Scaling For Bitcoin Mainstream\\nAdoptionBitcoin, as noted in Satoshi Nakamoto’s original white paper, was designed and introduced\\nto operate as a peer to peer electronic cash system. Due to its high fees and relatively long\\nconfirmation times however, since 2015, bitcoin has begun to operate as digital gold. In order for\\nbitcoin to appeal to the masses, it needs to be able to handle small payments that are cheap, secure\\nand fast. In other words, for bitcoin to surpass the value of reserve currencies and obtain a massive\\nuser base, it has to refer back to Nakamoto’s original vision of bitcoin.Technologically, bitcoin is not\\nthere yet. The open source development community of bitcoin is working toward adding a settlement\\nlayer on top of bitcoin so that it can operate as both digital gold and settlement network.\\nTechnologies like Segwit, Lightning and Tumblebit are all designed to add that second layer of\\ninfrastructure to handle small payments for day-to-day users.In a way, the comparison digital\\ncurrencies such as bitcoin to fiat currencies or reserve currencies that are actively utilized by their\\nusers on a daily basis could be incoherent. However, if bitcoin is used as a digital cash system as\\nNakamoto outlined in 2009 in the future, then this comparison could be more\\nrelevant.https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-now-larger-fiat-currencies-europe-americas-mark\\net-cap/\\n\\n',\n",

Bitcoin’s price has risen roughly 900% in the same period. (How high will it\\ngo in 2018? Read the cover story of our January 2018 issue.)In the first 11 or so months of 2017,\\nLinkedIn says job postings with Bitcoin in the headline grew to 4,917 listings—a jump of 5,753%. If\\nyou can believe it, that figure is higher than even the rise of Bitcoin’s price in the same time frame\\n(more than 3,151%).“The rise in the value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies over the past 12\\nmonths has opened the market up to many retail and institutional investors who were previously\\nsitting on the sidelines,” a representative for the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said\\nin a statement. “As the size of the market has grown, Coinbase has added the right people to\\nensure our platform and customers are properly supported, and we have approximately doubled our\\nheadcount in the last year.”Still, not all of of the LinkedIn job postings are directly related to Bitcoin.\\nSome are likely also related to Bitcoin’s underlying technology, the blockchain. Though institutional\\ngiants like J.P. Morgan dismiss Bitcoin as an investment, they do find value in the blockchain and its\\npotential application as a store of information for banks, healthcare providers, and even the pork\\nsupply chain.It is admittedly challenging to discern the extent that the LinkedIn job listings\\nspecifically seek blockchain-savvy applicants, as Bitcoin and blockchain are often mentioned in\\ntandem. (About 4,541 of LinkedIn job postings that mention Bitcoin also mention the blockchain.)\\nStill, the listings come from startups as well as established companies such as\\n[/f500link]Citigroup[/f500link] who are trying to leverage and understand the technology.There is also\\ncareer opportunity in the regulation of digital currencies. The rise of cryptocurrencies has prompted\\nquestions about how the new class of assets should be taxed and if it’s inheritable. That’s pushed\\nlaw firms Pepper Hamilton and Latham Watkins to put more brainpower to the topic, though neither\\nhave made additional hires with the specific need to cover cryptocurrencies.The cryptocurrency jobs\\nmarket is still relatively small. As Bitcoin jobs have hit record highs—relatively speaking, of\\ncourse—on LinkedIn, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that startups, defined as\\n\\n\\x0ccompanies up to one year old, have collectively contributed at least 1.4 million jobs every year in the\\npast two decades.The recent drop in Bitcoin’s price has fanned fears of a broader downturn that\\ncould affect related jobs. After rising over $19,000 in the holiday season, the price of Bitcoin fell as\\nlow as $12,000. As of Tuesday, the cryptocurrency trades around $16,000.Still, “In an industry as\\nnew as cryptocurrency,” says ZipRecruiter economist Cathy Barrera, “I would expect fluctuations in\\nthe pace of job opening growth and of growth in job applicant pool.”Recent growing pains suggest\\nmore hands are needed in the nascent industry. When investors rushed to buy Bitcoin ahead of the\\nCBOE and CME’s Bitcoin futures launches earlier this month, Coinbase struggled to keep up with\\nthe trades. Similarly, when the price of Bitcoin fell 20% a week ago, users found themselves unable\\nto buy and sell due to what appeared to be technical errors. Addressing the issue earlier this month,\\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wasn’t concerned.

While bitcoin has surged\\nin value by more than 900% this year, its total value stands at about $300bn, paling in comparison\\nto the total value of global shares at almost $80tn.Senior financiers including the chief executives of\\nJP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have warned against bitcoin in recent months, while the chairman\\nof the Royal Bank of Scotland likened it to Dante’s Inferno, saying it was a speculative bubble in\\nneed of an apocalyptic health warning for investors from central banks.There have been fears over\\nthe ability for banks to cover losses on bitcoin trading, with a group of major investment banks\\nwriting a letter to US regulators to say that the system of regulation was ill-prepared.The\\ncryptocurrency has become increasingly part of the wider financial system, after making its debut on\\nthe world’s largest futures exchange on Sunday evening, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\\n(CME) became the second exchange to offer bitcoin derivatives trading.The January 2018 contract\\n\\n\\x0ctraded on the CME initially spiked above $20,000 but later dropped, having been originally priced at\\n$19,500.A note of caution was sounded by Wouter den Haan of the London School of Economics,\\nwho responded to the survey by saying that past crises showed it could “take just one key financial\\ninstitution taking on large risky positions to put the system at risk”.Although the majority of\\neconomists believed there were limited risks to financial stability, they also said governments should\\nintroduce greater controls for cryptocurrencies as their anonymity and opacity could help enable tax\\nevasion and other criminal activities.Nicholas Oulton of the London School of Economics said: “One\\nstrand of current policy is to crack down on money laundering and tax evasion through tax havens.\\nSo it would seem odd to let cryptocurrencies get around these restrictions.”The findings come after a\\nSouth Korean cryptocurrency exchange appears set to file for bankruptcy after it was hacked for the\\nsecond time this year, highlighting concerns about security amid booming trade in bitcoin and other\\nvirtual currencies.The exchange, called Youbit, had been hacked once before in April when nearly\\n4,000 bitcoins were stolen in a cyber-attack that the country’s spy agency linked to North Korea,\\naccording to a recent South Korean newspaper report.Youbit announced on its website on Tuesday\\nthat it had been hacked at 4.35am local time, causing a loss worth 17% of its total assets.It did not\\nelaborate on the amount, but said all customers’ cryptocurrency assets would be marked down to\\n75% of their value.

       " '[2018-11-14]': 'Amazon Wins Patents for Cryptography and Distributed Data Storage SolutionsE-commerce giant\\nAmazon has won two patents related to methods for protecting the integrity of digital signatures and\\nimproving distributed data storage. The two patents were published by by the U.S. Patent and\\nTrademark Office (USPTO) today, Nov. 13.The first patent document, first filed in April of this year,\\noutlines a “signature delegation” method for “protecting the integrity of digital signatures and\\nencrypted communications,” by allowing for the generation, distribution, validation, and revocation of\\none-time-use cryptographic keys.In the proposed system, these keys are arranged in what is known\\nin cryptography as a “Merkle Tree” structure, which is a binary tree of hashes constructed from the\\nbottom up.As tech media platform Hackernoon outlines, Merkle Trees are a “fundamental part” of\\nblockchain systems, as they allow for a large body of data to be efficiently and securely verified:“The\\nMerkle Root summarizes all of the data in the related transactions, and is stored in the block header.\\nIt maintains the integrity of the data. If a single detail in any of the transactions or the order of the\\ntransactions changes, so does the Merkle Root. Using a Merkle tree allows for a quick and simple\\ntest of whether a specific transaction is included in the set or not.”According to the newly published\\npatent document, Amazon’s proposed Merkle Tree-structured, encrypted system aims to tackle how\\nto delegate signing authority from a central entity to the various subordinates that are authorized to\\nsign on its behalf.As the patent filing reads: “the signature authority provides a key-distribution\\nservice that distributes blocks of cryptographic keys to authorized signing delegates. An authorized\\nsigning delegate contacts the key-distribution service and requests a block of cryptographic keys.”In\\ncases where a given cryptographic key is “marked as invalid,” after a “key revocation service queries\\nthe Merkle tree of delegable keys,” then the service “provides the verifying entity with a revocation\\nvalue associated with the revoked cryptographic key.” Amazon outlines that in some cases, the key\\nrevocation database may be implemented using blockchain.Amazon’s second patent, released\\ntoday and first filed mid-Dec. 2015, relates to issues pertaining to distributed data storage.Amazon’s\\nfiling proposes a “grid encoding technique,” using groups of collected “shards,” where each shard\\nrepresents a logical distribution of data items stored in a given grid. The patent filing suggests this\\nmethod can help to minimize storage redundancy, while allowing for maximum availability, durability,\\nand means of recovery.Notably, several tech startups, such as Filecoin, Sia, Storj, and Swarm have\\nall attempted to tackle similar issues with distributed data storage using blockchain technology, often\\ncombined with cloud storage solutions.Beyond pursuing blockchain, cryptography and distributed\\ndata storage-related patents to expand its technological arsenal, Amazon has also filed for\\ncryptocurrency-specific inventions. In April, Amazon Technologies was awarded a patent for a\\nstreaming data marketplace that would enable users to receive real-time crypto transaction\\ndata.Source:\\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/amazon-wins-patents-for-cryptography-and-distributed-data-storage-\\nsolutions\\n\\n',\n",

       " '[2018-03-24]': 'Segwit and BCH Show There’s More Than One Way to Scale a BlockchainBlockchain scaling is one\\n\\n\\x0cpart technical, one part ideological. There was a number of reasons that led to the fork of bitcoin\\ncore in August to form bitcoin cash, but at its heart it came down to increasing transaction capacity.\\nSegwit sought to compress the amount of data in each transaction, thereby freeing up block space,\\nwhile bitcoin cash made the size of each block bigger, up to a maximum of 8MB. New data\\npublished by Bitmex Research shows how each chain has fared since bitcoin core and bitcoin cash\\nwent their separate ways.The cumulative transaction volume between BCH and Segwit is\\nremarkably close, showing that each scaling solution has found their levels of support. Bitmex\\nResearch explains: “Since the launch of Bitcoin Cash, 6.1 million Segwit transactions have taken\\nplace, only 20.1% more than the cumulative number of Bitcoin Cash transactions…Adjusting for the\\none-month head start [BCH had], SegWit has 31.5% more cumulative transaction volume than\\nBitcoin Cash, larger than 20.1% but still reasonably close.”The Race Between Segwit and Bitcoin\\nCash Is Heating UpTotal transaction volume for Segwit and BCH is extremely close.Segwit Had a\\nSlow StartSegwit adoption was low from the outset, and remained that way for several months,\\nallowing bitcoin cash to get a head start. By late December, the total transaction volume of BCH and\\nSegwit was neck and neck at around 4 million transactions apiece. It is only in the last month, when\\nCoinbase belatedly introduced Segwit, pushing its adoption rate over 30% for the first time, that its\\ntotal transaction volume has been able to compete with bitcoin cash.Proponents of each chain have\\nreasons to be content with these figures, and of how the future is shaping up for their preferred\\nscaling solution. As Bitmex Research notes:Although the data suggests that Segwit transaction\\nhave been adopted slightly faster than Bitcoin Cash, resulting in more transaction volume, Bitcoin\\nCash advocates could argue that the Bitcoin Cash token is more about a philosophy of larger\\ncapacity in the long term, rather than the speed of the actual increase in transaction volume in the\\nshort term. Therefore Bitcoin Cash supporters can still claim that Bitcoin Cash will eventually have\\nmore transaction volume than Bitcoin, once adoption of the coin increases.Bitcoin Core Block Sizes\\nFall to Their Smallest in Two YearsLast week, the average block size for bitcoin core (BCT) fell to\\njust over 0.5MB, its smallest since January 2016. Around 22% of block space is taken up by Segwit\\ntransactions, showing that the scaling technology is still under-utilized. The dramatic reduction in\\nBTC block space owes less to Segwit and more to improved batching coupled with reduced\\ntransaction volume. It is no coincidence that the average number of daily BTC transactions is also at\\nits lowest level in two years.The Race Between Segwit and Bitcoin Cash Is Heating UpBTC block\\nsizes are at their lowest in two years.The average number of daily BTC to BCH transactions for the\\nmoment maintains an average ratio of 10:1, which also mirrors each asset’s respective price.\\nHowever, total transaction fees for sending BTC in the last 24 hours are 200x greater than BCH.\\nEven if the transaction volume on each chain was equal, in other words, BTC would still cost 20x\\nmore to\\nsend.https://news.bitcoin.com/the-race-between-segwit-and-bitcoin-cash-is-heating-up/?utm_source\\n=OneSignal%20Push&utm_medium=notification&utm_campaign=Push%20Notifications\\n\\n',\n",

For a brief period of time, the Chinese exchange market\\novertook the US in terms of market share to become the largest bitcoin market in the world, for the\\nfirst time since November of 2016.Although bitcoin is being traded at around $4,000 in China, nearly\\n$200 lower than the US market, Chinese exchanges have demonstrated low trading rates for the\\nbitcoin-to-Chinese yuan pair throughout 2017. Immediately after the imposition of strict regulations\\nand policies on bitcoin trading platforms in 2016, investors stopped trading bitcoin at a premium rate\\nwithin the Chinese exchange market.One important indicator of the Chinese bitcoin market’s\\nrecovery which investors must acknowledge is the rapidly growing trading volume of the Chinese\\nexchange and over-the-counter markets. Under normal circumstances, a massive sell-off should\\nhave occurred when reports from Caixin and the Wall Street Journal were released about the plans\\nof the People’s Bank of China, the central bank of the country, to suspend or ban bitcoin trading\\nplatforms.The Wall Street Journal is a massively influential mainstream media publication in the\\nglobal finance sector. But, Caixin is a state-owned media company in China, which has insider\\nsources within the government and in the Chinese central bank. When the initial report of Caixin was\\nreleased, the Chinese bitcoin market crashed, bringing the price of bitcoin down to the $4,000\\nregion. Many analysts expected the release of WSJ’s report to slow down the momentum of bitcoin\\neven further. But, in contrary, bitcoin has recovered to over $4,200 today, with the Chinese bitcoin\\nexchange market demonstrating high trading volumes and US investors moving bitcoin price\\nupwards.More to that, within a single day, bitcoin price in the Chinese exchange market rose by 9.3\\npercent, while other markets such as the US, Japan and South Korea remained stagnant.\\nMomentum is rebuilding in China, despite the ongoing bitcoin exchange ban talks and the PBoC’s\\nsupposed introduction of plans to suspend bitcoin exchanges indefinitely.Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC,\\nthe three leading bitcoin exchanges in China, have all stated that they do not believe the ban will be\\napproved and are not even sure if it is the actual plan of PBoC. The three companies reassured\\ntheir clients that they have not received any directives from PBoC and that they are willing to comply\\nwith any requests from the Chinese government and its financial regulators.The optimistic and\\nconfident approach from leading Chinese exchanges in regard to the rumours emerged due to the\\nreport of Caixin has started to trigger new upward momentum for the Chinese bitcoin exchange\\nmarket.More to that, the Chinese bitcoin industry and market have regained trust over bitcoin and its\\nlegal status in China. According to bitcoin market data provider Coin Dance, demand toward bitcoin\\n\\n\\x0cin over-the-counter and peer-to-peer bitcoin markets such as LocalBitcoins has actually increased\\nover the past two weeks.It is still unsure whether the report of Caixin on the ban on bitcoin\\nexchanges is accurate and if the Chinese government is considering imposing a temporary\\nsuspension on its local trading platforms.

That course would\\nmean making it easier to trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrency, good for a fintech sector\\nthat has begun flourishing even without clear rules.“There needs to be a whole new set of\\nframeworks and narratives to position crypto and its underlying technology blockchain as the\\nstrength that Taiwan can develop,” says Jason Hsu, a minority party lawmaker who is pushing\\nregulators and other legislators to approve a “playbook” on cryptocurrency. “Once that idea is\\ninstilled in their minds, I think we will see a quick switch happening.”History of hesitationTaiwan now\\ntakes a “neutral” view on cryptocurrency, a publicist with government regulator the Financial\\nRegulatory Commission said for this post Thursday.

Two\\nTaiwan-based platforms and an estimated 25,000 local users already trade it. Some major banks\\nare developing their own schemes, the lawmaker says. Fintech startups including a cryptocurrency\\nwallet firm are also popping up in Taiwan. Younger people want to do more with crypto, Hsu\\nsays.Officials worry that cryptocurrency might enable financial crime, defy taxation, or hobble\\nTaiwan’s conventional banks, Hsu says. The Financial Supervisory Commission warned of \"risk\" in\\nDecember because of price volatility in public cryptocurrency trading.In 2015 the commission’s\\nex-chairman Tseng Ming-chung called the currencies illegal, particularly Bitcoin ATMs. But the\\nopinions were just his own, recalls John Eastwood, a partner with Eiger Law in Taipei. “Tseng\\'s\\ndeclarations about Bitcoin, despite never being supported or acted upon by the commission, have\\nmade their way into a lot of news reports that didn\\'t catch that Tseng was just saying his own\\nopinions,” he says.Early signs of changeIn October 2017, today’s commission Chairman Wellington\\nKoo pledged at a joint cabinet-parliament session to pursue a friendlier “stance” on development of\\ncryptocurrency and its public ledger blockchain, the FinTech Law Blog reports.Two months later,\\nparliament approved the Act on Financial Technology Innovations and Experiments to let fintech\\nstartups including cryptocurrency developers avoid regulations that apply to older firms.

Startups would need to apply one by one, starting\\nnext month, to qualify for the protections, the commission spokesperson says.But legislators will wait\\nfor cues from government before considering any regulations that cover cryptocurrency itself, Hsu\\nsays. It probably won’t get parliamentary support in the first half of 2018, so lawmakers are talking\\nthis month about how to issue “guidelines” on cryptocurrency, he says. Guidelines would clarify\\nwhat’s OK and not before any formal regulation can pass, Hsu says.Regulatory tightening\\noverseasTaiwan will not go the direction of China and South Korea, which last year banned\\ncryptocurrency fundraisers called initial coin offerings (ICOs), Koo told the joint session in\\nOctober.Ralph JenningsTaiwan legislator Jason Hsu, an advocate of cryptocurrency liberalization,\\nstands in his Taipei parliament office on March 20, 2018.

For instance, in 2013, the Chinese\\ngovernment and its financial regulators had banned Bitcoin on two separate occasions. PBoC went\\nas far to ban Bitcoin transactions and trading activities. But, as trading activities simply moved over\\nto over-the-counter markets and the market became even more difficult to regulate, PBoC and\\nChinese financial regulators came to a consensus to legalize and regulate Bitcoin.Singapore\\noptimismA similar situation may transpire with the ICO market. If ICOs and Blockchain startups\\nsimply move to Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, countries that have expressed their optimism\\ntowards ICOs, the ban on ICOs by the Chinese government will only hurt the Chinese Blockchain\\nsector.https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-ban-on-ico-is-temporary-licensing-to-be-introduced-offic\\nial\\n\\n\",\n",

Moments after the bitcoin price\\nsurpassed $11,000, it dropped to $9,000, and almost immediately after, the mainstream media was\\neager to publish a series of articles on the next bitcoin crash.“News outlets haven’t even had 24\\nhours to let the ‘10k’ news simmer and it already went up to $11,500. By the time they published the\\n‘11K’ piece, it already dropped to $9,000. As soon as they entered the last word on their ‘Bitcoin is\\ncrashing!’ article, it’s back at $11,000 per BTC,” wrote Cuneta.With the price of bitcoin nearly at\\n$12,000, bitcoin is now the world’s sixth most valuable circulating currency in the world, within eight\\nyears since its launch in 2009. Hence, while the majority of mainstream media outlets and analysts\\nin the traditional finance sector are fixated on the short-term price trend of bitcoin, Cuneta explained\\nthat bitcoin will likely become much larger than most can imagine, as it goes about separating\\nmoney and state.“So, we could be watching one of the biggest financial bubbles in history unfold\\nwith this cryptocurrency mania. Yet on the other side of the coin, there is also the non-trivial\\npossibility that we are witnessing something remarkable happening before our very eyes — the\\nreturn of the separation of cash and state,” Cuneta noted.Currently, bitcoin is a robust store of value\\nand an alternative to traditional assets like gold. But, with efficient scaling and widespread adoption,\\nin the upcoming years, bitcoin will likely compete against reserve currencies and government-issued\\nmoney.Long-Term Future Beyond $12,000Bitcoin has surpassed the $11,000 mark and is expected\\nto surpass $12,000 within December, given the entrance of institutional investors and tens of billions\\nof dollars in capital. As institutional money flows into the bitcoin market through bitcoin futures, the\\n$165 billion market cap of bitcoin will increase rapidly, providing more liquidity.The network effect of\\nbitcoin and the dominance of the cryptocurrency will continue to attract more investors in the global\\nfinance market to bitcoin. As Cuneta added:“Over one third of a trillion dollars. That’s the total\\namount of cryptocurrencies in the world. $165 Billion belongs to Bitcoin alone, which just shows how\\ndominant network effects can be. Because of Bitcoin technology, the power to create money was\\ngranted to every human being on earth and taken away from kings, oligarchs, and governments.”For\\nthis particular reason, several respected investors within the cryptocurrency space have expressed\\ntheir optimism towards bitcoin price reaching $45,000 by the end of 2018, achieving a $1 trillion\\nmarket cap.Source:\\nhttps://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/11874-bitcoin-price-achieves-new-time-high-beginning/\\n\\n',\n",

At the time, he said:\\xa0 \\xa0 \"The main use of bitcoin has been\\nto circumvent tax authorities and regulation. I think the U.S. government did the right of thing of\\nshutting or trying to shut it down and I think effectively…it has done that.Interestingly, since then his\\noutlook toward the crypto market has somewhat shifted, if only slightly. In January, while speaking at\\nthe World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, he said that the U.S. should\\nphase out fiat currency and move toward the use of digital currencies.The topic of discussion at the\\ntime focused on the issue of corruption, tax evasion and tax avoidance. According to Stiglitz, the\\nphasing out of money and introducing digital currency has ‘benefits that outweigh the cost,’ in the\\nlong term.Harvard professor and economist Kenneth Rogoff has also said that cash provided the\\nideal avenue for tax evasion, and that the time was now to reduce fiat money.No doubt Stiglitz’s\\nmost recent comments will raise a few eyebrows, and is unlikely to go down well bitcoin enthusiasts;\\nhowever, given the upward trajectory that the digital currency is currently on, it’s not likely that it will\\nhave much impact on where the market is heading.Source:\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BcGFXl3AkCC/?taken-by=bloombergbusinessSource:\\nhttps://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/nobel-prize-winning-economist-bitcoin-should-be-outlawed/\\n\\n',\n",

The CBA says the deal will yield a 2.2 percent\\nreturn.The move is the latest and most significant by a global banking company, as it marks a shift\\ntoward the use and understanding of the possibilities of blockchain systems. \\xa0 \\xa0In an exclusive\\ninterview with Cointelegraph, the World Bank’s Paul Snaith, who is head of treasury operations,\\ncapital markets banking and payments, gave an inside look at the path taken to leverage blockchain\\ntechnology at the institution, as well as the World Bank’s thoughts on cryptocurrencies:Why\\nblockchain, why Commonwealth Bank of Australia?Cointelegraph: How long has this\\nblockchain-based bond has been in development and why the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in\\nparticular was chosen to develop this platform?Paul Snaith: We began considering that in August\\n2017, and after a while, we established the formal arrangement with CBA in January 2018.There are\\nthree areas that are significant. On the first level, there is a very positive environment nurturing\\nblockchain fintech. We think all levels of the Australian government are interested in all these\\ntechnologies, and we think the regulators there are interested in what’s going on.I think the example\\nwe used is that Australia’s stock exchange chose individual asset holdings to replace their equity\\nsettlement system in 2016. In a significant market like Australia, the equity settlement system and\\nmajor market infrastructure is a powerful indication of understanding the benefits of the technology\\nand governmental support — that’s at the governmental regulatory level.CBA, they are innovative.\\nWe’ve worked with them for a very long time. We were aware of their prototype transactions, which\\nthey’ve been doing since January 2017. <...> We are aware that they’ve got a significant corporate\\ncommitment to innovation and that they understand this kind of technology is both a threat and\\nopportunity in every line of business that they have. That’s why they have the innovation lab in Hong\\nKong, one in Sydney and one in London. We recognize them as innovative.Lastly, the market: The\\nWorld Bank has been issuing debt in Australia for a long time. We’ve been reactive to the Australian\\nmarket and investors are familiar with our name. It’s a very convenient place for us to do business.\\nWhether at the regulatory level, the innovation level or the market level where our name is used, it’s\\npositive all round.Cointelegraph: Was there any other country that you might have considered or any\\nother field that you might have considered in order to move this project forward?PS: We had quite a\\nfew preliminary conversations with various technology firms in the second half of 2017, but none\\nquite resonated in the complete sense that I’ve given you for Australia. We use the term ‘contained’\\n— its the most contained-based market with positive views in regard to our partner, with innovation\\nand regulation.World Bank and cryptocurrenciesPS: The bank is considering developing an official\\nline in that regard, and we do not have one at this time. But within that context, we have been\\nhaving internal conversations about that. \\xa0 \\xa0The key thing is with cryptocurrencies that are using\\nproof-of-work, and therefore considerable power and energy use in establishing consensus — we\\nare primarily a development agency and we care deeply about development issues — including\\ncarbon dioxide emissions and power generation, which contributes to global warming, and so\\non.We’re a little discomforted by the power usage associated with proof-of-work, for example. We\\nare an official organization owned by over 190 countries, so AML and CFTC rules are very important\\nfor us, and there are still concerns about AML and CFTC with the use of crypto. And we think it’s\\nimportant that we don’t associate with that until we have a clear framework to do so. Those are\\nsome of the reasons why we would not do that at the moment. \\xa0 \\xa0We did look at using a crypto token\\nfor the settlement on this bond transaction — but chose not to — primarily to de-risk the transaction\\na little bit to enable familiarity for all our investors with regard to the cash side of the\\n\\n\\x0ctransactions.Getting investors to come into a significantly large transaction like this means us giving\\nthem comfort. They are certainly comforted by our name: We operate in a massive market and we\\nare AAA rated. But there’s new technology underpinning it, so it's important that we de-risk the\\ntransaction on the cash settlement portion.We are very, very interested in how that side of the\\nequation will develop and we will continue looking at that. We have no generic opposition to what I\\nhave described. We grouped these technologies both on the transfer of securities on a register and\\nthe exchange of ownership of the cash piece, so both of those problems are going to be solved in\\nthe long run, which will reform these markets and make them so much faster.Blockchain-based\\nbonds and the banking sectorPS: We are a big name in this market and we hope it’s going to catch\\nattention. I think you are already aware of large players in international markets that are already\\ndoing some activities and exploration. We mentioned Australia’s stock exchange, which is\\nfundamental — we have not seen big infrastructure projects in other areas yet, but there’s a lot of\\nresearch being done in places like Singapore, Canada and elsewhere. We hope this is going to give\\na nudge in that direction.Lastly, we are primarily a development organization. This transaction really\\nhelps us learn. We’ve always been innovative in the capital markets. We hope to deepen our\\nunderstanding of the impact of this technology in the capital markets, and we certainly look forward\\nto doing exploration with regard to other means of moving value. We think there is considerable\\npromise for these technologies to help that part of the world which is presently unbanked or has little\\naccess to financial services.We’ve got a deep interest in seeing how these technologies can be\\napplied for the benefit of the poorest in the world, and that’s a major focus as an institution.Source:\\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/banking-on-blockchain-world-bank-unpacks-launch-of-bondi-bond-wi\\nth-australias-cba\\n\\n\",\n",

Analysts expect the trend to continue, despite the recent decline in\\nbitcoin’s price.Precious Metal Capital Diverts To BitcoinThomson Reuters analysts, in their 2017\\nGold Survey released in January, noted the rising cryptocurrency prices in December diverted\\nsignificant amounts of capital from precious metals. The report said retail investors have a shorter\\ninvestment horizon nowadays, and many were unable to resist the temptation to get on board with\\ncryptocurrency.Christopher Louney, RBC Capital Markets strategist, said the development – a\\npotential correlation between gold’s value and cryptocurrency prices – is fairly recent, reports\\nFortune. He said he has noticed a potential correlation between gold’s value and cryptocurrency\\nprices.While there was no relationship previously, Louney said the trend emerged late in 2017 and\\ncontinued into early 2018—indicating that as bitcoin’s price soared in quadruple digits, investors\\ncould have been offloading gold to buy cryptocurrencies.Louney stressed the correlation is\\nminor—not enough to move gold prices, and not enough to say that investors are presently\\nconsidering bitcoin as gold’s replacement. The macroeconomic factors that have traditionally\\nimpacted gold prices continue to dominate the playing field, such as stock market\\nperformance.Louney said he expects gold prices to end the year lower than they started, around\\n$1,303 on average for the year, mainly due to rising equity returns.A Long Road AheadBitcoin,\\nbesides being volatile, is still a relatively unknown asset compared to other investment assets. Gold,\\nby comparison, is well established with institutional investors and has plenty of liquidity.While bitcoin\\ntrading volumes totaled to just over $3 billion in daily trading recently, gold trading volumes hit $250\\nbillion a day, according to the World Gold Council.The bitcoin-gold correlation could increase over\\ntime, said Looney. The evolving relationship also means the converse could occur, whereby bitcoin\\ninvestors cash in their cryptocurrency in hard times for gold as a less volatile asset.In a report sent\\nto the bank’s clients in January, Goldman Sachs analyst Zach Pandl wrote that the rapid increase in\\ndemand for bitcoin has been triggered by the growing dissatisfaction with regulated monetary\\n\\n\\x0csystems and the current banking infrastructures.In the long-term, as cryptocurrencies mature and\\nevolve into a major asset class, Pandl said digital currencies like bitcoin will pose lower returns but\\ndemonstrate a high level of stability, like gold and other safe-haven assets.Source:\\nhttps://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-new-gold/\\n\\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein might say that the investment banking giant does not have a\\n“Bitcoin strategy,” but the company is now admitting that cryptocurrencies pose a business risk to\\nthe firm.Full article on CNN\\n\\n With Circle’s acquisition, SEC will not take legal action against Poloniex, according to a leaked slide\\nfrom a confidential Circle presentation.Source:\\nhttps://cryptocomes.com/leaked-sec-agreed-not-pursue-enforcement-action-against-poloniex-if-acqu\\nired-circle\\n\\n\\x0cLow-income areas in the city of Detroit are seeing a bunch of cryptocurrency-based automated teller\\nmachines (ATM). According to local reports, ATMs are popping up in great number in liquor stores,\\ngas stations, and cash-checking locations.Detroit Michigan Sees a Crypto-ATM InvasionDetroit is a\\nwell known industrial city and Michigan’s most populous city. However, the region has been dealing\\nwith a tumultuous economy and the city residents have been suffering from financial hardships for\\nyears. That hasn’t stopped a large influx of bitcoin ATMs from being installed in the city as Detroit\\nnow has over 29 machines. The regional newspaper the Detroit News reveals that most of these\\ndevices reside in areas with a shortage of banks and low-income housing areas like Inkster,\\nHighland Park, Taylor, Hamtramck, and Pontiac. There are 15 more crypto-ATMs on the outskirts of\\nMetro Detroit as well. Ayman Rida, an executive from a company called ‘International Bitcoin’\\ninstalled a good chunk of the machines located in the Metro Detroit region.“My company installed 15\\nBitcoin ATMs last year in Detroit,” explains Rida in an Interview. Rida says most transactions are\\nroughly between $70-80 USD. “Last year, the business grew very, very good at the locations,” Rida\\nadds.Services for the Unbanked and UnderbankedCryptocurrency proponents in the area believe\\nthe Detroit crypto-ATMs help the underbanked within the region. Although, some law-enforcement\\nofficials believe some of the action may be helping facilitate illegal activities and money laundering.\\nA cryptocurrency researcher from a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, the Foundation for Defense\\nof Democracies (FDD) believes bitcoin in Detroit is probably being used for both of those\\ntheories.“The truth is, it could be both scenarios,” Yaya Fanusie explains. “It’s a guess because the\\ntechnology is new — We need time to collect data,”\"The fact that [Bitcoin ATMs] are in the kind of\\nareas you describe, only says how much digital currency is growing worldwide — Bitcoin has sort of\\ngrown as way to provide services to the unbanked and underbanked.\"Despite the Concerns From\\nLawmakers Cryptocurrency Use Is Thriving in DetroitAccording to the local news outlet, 14 Detroit\\nstores in the Metro region with bitcoin ATMs were contacted, but none of the owners wanted to\\nmake a statement. The FDD researcher Fanusie doesn’t believe that money laundering is a big\\nissue for crypto-ATM owners in Detroit. Fanusie emphasizes, “That kind of money would essentially\\nbe noticed by federal regulators — But if you want to use them to pay a local drug dealer, say $50 to\\n$100, then maybe it’s OK, effective.”Michigan and the Detroit region is home to quite a few\\nbitcoiners.

By determining the challenges and opportunities the committee are hoping to see what\\nimpact it can have on its own securities market. They will then examine, deliberate and advise SEBI\\non an ongoing basis.SEBI said that technology is advancing at a fast rate and is ‘affecting financial\\nmarkets,’ whether through peer-to-peer lending, the blockchain, digital currencies, crowd funding or\\nalgorithmic trading.It added:\\xa0\\nare faced with the challenges as well as opportunities to evolve their functioning more effectively\\nthrough adoption of new technology solutions.\"The announcement comes at a time when India’s\\nfinancial establishments are taking a more proactive interest in the distributed ledger.Last year, it\\nwas reported that India’s second largest bank by assets, ICICI, was showing interest in the\\ndevelopment of blockchain applications.According to Chanda Kochhar, the bank’s managing\\ndirector and CEO, she said that the bank is prepared for a technological revolution bought on by\\ninnovations like the blockchain. Her comments followed a successful pilot of transactions that ICICI\\nhad executed over the blockchain.ICICI isn’t the only one exploring the blockchain’s potential.Axis\\nBank Ltd., and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., two other private financial institutions, revealed last\\nOctober that they were experimenting with blockchain-based solutions in different sectors of\\nbusinesses and industry.More recently, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., successfully completed an\\nend-to-end trade finance transaction with a client over a blockchain.

More than 83.2 billion transactions were settled on the Visa network in 2016.In\\ncontrast, the cryptocurrency market settles significantly less transactions on a daily basis. The\\nEthereum network settles more transactions than all of the cryptocurrencies in the market combined,\\nand the entire cryptocurrency market processes around 1 million transactions per day. That is, 30\\nmillion transactions per month and approximately 360 million transactions per year.However, core\\ndevelopers of most public blockchain networks such as bitcoin and Ethereum are working on the\\ndevelopment and deployment of second-layer payment networks. The utilization of second-layer\\n\\n\\x0cpayment channels like Lightning and Plasma will enable cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum\\nto remain as secure store of values, while payment channels operate like the Visa network and are\\nlaunched on top of the cryptocurrencies.A recent research paper from the Blockstream research\\nteam entitled “Scalable Funding of Bitcoin Micropayment Channel Networks” revealed that with\\nnecessary solutions in place such as micropayment channels can support at least 800 million users\\nwith the current infrastructure.“Micropayment channel networks create new problems, which have\\nnot been solved in the original papers [8,18]. We identify two main challenges – the blockchain\\ncapacity and locked-in funds. Even with increases in block size it was estimated that the blockchain\\ncapacity could only support about 800 million users with micropayment channels due to the number\\nof on-chain transactions required to open and close channels,” read the paper.With micropayment\\nchannel optimization through the elimination of channels and unnecessary information, the\\nBlockstream research paper noted that nearly 96 percent of the blockchain space, significantly\\nincreasing the capacity of transactions and number of users payment channels can handle.“By\\nhiding the channels from the blockchain, a reduction in blockchain space usage and thus the cost of\\nchannels is achieved. For a group of 20 nodes with 100 channels in between them, this can save up\\nto 96% of the blockchain space,” the paper added.Already, in terms of daily trading volume, the\\ncryptocurrency market is processing over $10 billion worth of trades on a daily basis, from\\ncryptocurrency to fiat and vice versa. The global cryptocurrency exchange market processes $3.6\\ntrillion in trades on a yearly basis, which is closer to the volume of the Visa network. It is fair to\\ncompare the trading volume of cryptocurrencies to the Visa network as both markets handle trades\\namongst hundreds of digital and government-issued fiat currencies.In the long-term, the transaction\\nvolume of cryptocurrencies will be able to surpass that of Visa, if on-chain and off-chain scaling\\nsolutions are implemented onto leading public blockchains.Source:\\nhttps://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/cryptocurrencies-surpass-market-cap-of-visa-at-285-billion/\\n\\n',\n",

Just last month, some of the Bitcoin funds that this malware strain had stolen were moved\\nfrom its original address. It now appears the remaining funds have been moved to a different\\naddress as well. Considering how BTC-e cannot launder the proceeds and BitMixer is gone, the\\nquestion now becomes where these funds will end up.WannaCry Bitcoin Funds Are Moving AgainIt\\nis somewhat easy to analyze the Bitcoin blockchain and flag suspicious wallets. That is exactly what\\nhappened with the WannaCry ransomware distribution wallets, which were easily sniffed out by\\nsecurity researchers. Ever since that time, people have been keeping a close eye on the balances\\nof those accounts to see if the funds would be moved over time. It appears that this is the case, and\\nthat funds were moved on two separate occasions.The first batch of funds was moved in July of this\\nyear. Although no one knows for sure where the money ended up, it is certainly possible that at\\nleast part of it wound up at the BTC-e exchange. Considering that the platform is responsible for\\nlaundering 95% of all global ransomware proceeds, no one would be surprised to learn that some\\nmoney had been converted to fiat currency through the company. The remainder of the funds, which\\nadded up to over US$140,000, has now been moved to an external address as well.Laundering the\\nWannaCry proceeds will be a lot more difficult than it had been before, as it is impossible to send\\nmoney to the BTC-e exchange since the domain was seized by U.S. law enforcement officials last\\nweek. It remains unclear if the platform will ever be operational again, but it seems highly unlikely\\nthat it will be. Secondly, the criminals cannot use BitMixer anymore, as the largest Bitcoin mixing\\nservice shut its doors not too long ago. Mixers are a great way to remove taint from a Bitcoin\\nbalance and eliminate any trace of where it came from or where it ended up.Spending the money on\\ndarknet markets will not be a walk in the park either. Both Hansa and AlphaBay were taken offline in\\nquick succession. There are legitimate reasons to believe that law enforcement officials will target\\nDream Market next, as they have been cracking down on all illegal online activity. Making\\nUS$140,000 worth of Bitcoin disappear and turning it into clean money will be pretty challenging, if\\nnot outright impossible at this point.There are other mixing service providers, however, which could\\nhelp out in this regard. We discussed a few of those service providers a while ago and most of them\\nare still operational to this very day. Another option would be to just sell the coins through\\nLocalBitcoins, although that might attract even more attention from law enforcement officials.\\nAgencies have been keeping a close eye on LocalBitcoins as well as anyone selling large amounts\\nof cryptocurrency.It is interesting to see this money being withdrawn right now. The motive behind\\nthis idea remains a big mystery, and there is seemingly no reason to move funds now rather than a\\nfew days or weeks ago. It remains uncertain if the money will be cashed out or just moved to more\\nsecure solutions. Bitcoin is very valuable right now and sitting on a lot of money can make even the\\ntoughest criminal a bit antsy.\\nhttps://themerkle.com/remaining-wannacry-bitcoin-money-is-on-the-move/\\n\\n',\n",

This isn\\'t a systemic shock in the same league as the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange\\ncollapse, but it\\'s a warning that transparency and trust are rare commodities in this world.The size\\nand scope of the attack are small by historic standards, hence why Bitcoin\\'s price bounced back to\\n$8,200 after sinking to about $7,800. About $31 million was stolen from Tether, a Bitcoin peer that\\nissues U.S. dollar-backed tokens for easier trading on crypto exchanges, and sent to what the\\ncompany calls an unauthorized bitcoin address. That\\'s more manageable than the collapse of Mt.\\nGox -- hacked for $450 million -- or last year\\'s $65 million theft at another exchange, Bitfinex.Bitcoin\\nShruggedNews of the Tether theft briefly knocked the price of Bitcoin, which has already bounced\\nbackBut the Tether raid shouldn\\'t be dismissed.It\\'s one example of how quickly a cryptocurrency\\'s\\nglitzy promise of instant liquidity and top-flight security can be shattered. Tether is a Top-20 digital\\ncurrency, which built its name on combining both cryptographic security and real-world monetary\\nvalue.Every Tether is supposed to be backed \"1-to-1\" by a corresponding hard currency, meaning\\nthat crypto exchanges and traders can trade it as a U.S. dollar proxy, safe in the knowledge that it\\nwill always be redeemable if the need arises. The \"best of both worlds,\" as Tether put it.In practice, it\\nlooks more like the worst of both worlds. Already, before the hack, Tether\\'s legal small-print made\\nclear that its tokens were neither money, nor stored value, nor currency. Redemption wasn\\'t\\n\\n\\x0cguaranteed.Jittery banks didn\\'t help, with Tether warning this year that its Taiwanese lenders had\\nblocked all incoming international wires since April. The hack is drying up another pool of crypto\\nliquidity: Several exchanges say they\\'re suspending Tether transactions, according to news website\\nBitcoin.com.There\\'s more. One part of Tether\\'s story yet to be fully explained is its link to Bitfinex,\\nthe exchange that was itself hacked last year. Tethers can be used on Bitfinex as a withdrawal and\\ndeposit method for crypto users, a kind of substitute for the traditional banking system.But the two\\ncompanies have other ties. They filed a lawsuit together against U.S. bank Wells Fargo & Co. over\\nthose aforementioned frozen international transfers, according to American Banker magazine,\\nfueling speculation that they\\'re linked through ownership. So Tether\\'s wider impact could hit both\\ngeneral liquidity on crypto exchanges and any companies with which it has ties.The risks of trading\\ncryptocurrencies are well-known, of course, as are the rewards.This hack has done little to halt\\nBitcoin\\'s speculative price bubble, and Wall Street is still watching closely. But the next big attack\\nmight not be so easy to digest -- especially with the arrival of bitcoin futures trading that will make it\\neasier to pile on bearish bets.

One of the more common ways for\\nconsumers to spend Bitcoin is by buying gift cards from various retailers and outlets. Popular Bitcoin\\ngift card services will often offer a small discount on every purchase. Giving consumers an extra\\nincentive to spend digital currency. A recent survey by CardCash shows how Starbucks gift cards\\n\\n\\x0care a clear fan favorite, whereas Visa Gift Cards are far less preferable. Most of these trends seem\\nto correlate with how consumers would spend USD balances on gift cards,\\nthough.http://bitcoinist.net/bitcoin-users-at-cardcash-spend-more-and-favor-starbucks-gift-cards/\\n\\n',\n",

       " '[2016-05-19]': 'The report, The Blockchain Audit Trail: Helping to Establish Government “Data Authority” and\\nInformation Accuracy, was specifically intended to be a market report for government uses for the\\nblockchain. According to the report, it’s possible that blockchain technologies could be a key tool for\\nconfirming data origin and accuracy, tracking updates, and establishing true data authority for\\nmillions of different data fields.One of the report’s main findings is the blockchain’s ability to track\\nand store government records in a secure and transparent manner, helping to improve the\\nauthenticity of the documents. The blockchain would be able to track records by confirming their\\nexistence in a block — where other entries related to those activities can be found through a shared\\nrecord that is both immutable and hack-resistant.The IDC report says that the blockchain capabilities\\ncould improve government functions such as digital voting, land registries, patent, copyright and\\ntrademark issues, even mentioning smart contracts associated with Internet of Things\\nsolutions.There were 3 main areas of focus in the IDC’s research on the blockchain: data authority,\\ndata accuracy, and access control.Data authority – Such authority, not only where each piece of\\ndata comes from, but also who has authority over it (related to accuracy, changes, and lifecycle\\nmanagement), and where the ultimate authoritative copy of that data resides.Data accuracy –\\nAccuracy is a key component of data quality. Accuracy means that data values stored for any object\\nare correct, that they represent the right value, and that they are consistent in form and\\ncontent.Access control – Blockchain solutions can help keep track of what information is public\\nversus private. This can include details on the data itself, the transaction related to the data, and\\nwho is allowed to make updates to data records.According to the IDC report, the government will be\\nexperimenting with the blockchain going forward to test its functionality in those 3 areas of concern.\\nThey will conduct a series of tests to prove the worth of the blockchain as a concept, and to\\ndetermine where and when they can specifically apply the technology to discover which ways they\\nwill be able to leverage the blockchain’s capabilities.\\n\\n\\x0c'}"
